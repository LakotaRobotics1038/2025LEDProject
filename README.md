2. Install MicroPico extension from the workspace recommended
3. `CTRL+SHIFT+P` and run `MicroPico: Configure project`

## Troubleshooting

- If this is not the first time that program has been flashed, empty the flash memory [here](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/soft/flash_nuke.uf2) and re-flash the program [here](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO/).
- If the animation does not start, disconnect the Pico from all sources of power and plug it back in. This includes the USB port and GPIO pins.
